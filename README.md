During my internship, I excelled in developing GitLab adapters, achieving an impressive 80% automation in CI/CD pipelines. Leveraging Golang, I successfully engineered a ticket booking application, leading to a remarkable 40% increase in ticket sales and a commendable 25% reduction in booking errors. My proficiency in CRUD API operations, coupled with the application of Agile principles, resulted in a remarkable 40% boost in team efficiency and a valuable 20% reduction in project delivery time.

In the Golang domain, I acquired valuable knowledge on variables, data types, pointers, arrays, slices, and validation. Additionally, I efficiently executed CRUD API operations, contributing to the enhancement of the ticket booking app. My GitLab expertise extended to tasks such as creating projects, understanding the difference between Git and GitLab, forking projects, setting up SSH keys, managing GitLab runners, and implementing CI/CD pipelining.

Despite facing challenges, I persisted and successfully completed tasks. Gratitude for the guidance from Vaibhav Shete and Godley Mathew, with a special thank you to Sachin Londhe for the opportunity. A special note of appreciation to HR Ankita Shinde for unwavering support throughout this journey.

Thank You ..
